                <span class="bd em">Q) What about the Director's Cut?</span></br>
                A) The <span class="it">Director's Cut</span> consists of extended versions of Episodes 21 to 24. The extended
                versions feature scenes from the <span class="bd">Evangelion: Death</span> recap. Those extra scenes ended up making
                several remasters, including the <span class="it">Platinum Edition</span> remaster in 2001</br>
                <span class="em">The <span class="it">Platinum Edition</span> is the North American release of <span class="it">
                    Renewal of Evangelion</span>. It's best to not worry about quality, as most online services will have the
                Director's Cut.</span>

                development.</span></br>
                In response to fan's reactions, Hideaki Anno and his team created the "movie" <span class="bd">The End of Evangelion</span>,
                which is another ending for the original series.
